           <b>HTML provides the structure and meaning to web content.
            It utilizes a system of "tags" to define elements such as headings , paragraphs , lists , images , and links .</b>
            <i>These tags establish the hierarchy and organization of the content, making it understandable to web browsers and accessible to users with assistive technologies like screen readers.</i>
            <u>Semantic HTML, which involves using the correct tags for their intended purpose, is crucial for creating well-structured and accessible websites.</u>

        <p style="font-size: 15px;">
            CSS is a style sheet language used to control the visual presentation of HTML content.
            It dictates aspects like colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and responsiveness across different devices.
            CSS allows for the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), which improves maintainability and flexibility in web development.
            Styles can be applied in various ways: inline (within HTML tags), internal  or externally (in a separate .css file linked to the HTML document).
            External CSS is generally preferred for larger projects as it promotes reusability and easier management of styles across multiple web pages.
